    "text": "Master Thesis (submission October 2023): Human Activity Recognition From Wearable Sensor Data Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms\nAbstract: This thesis aims at providing a proof of concept for a larger project exploring child development and is situated within the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The focus lies on the recognition of ten distinct activities identified as pertinent to understand the daily life of children. The activities are: Walk, Run, Jump, Lie, Stand, Sit & Listen, Sit & Write, Sit & Read, Sit & Computer, Sit & Conversation. An experimental design was crafted, encompassing a sample of six participants, yielding nearly 12 hours of sensor data. The experimental setup incorporated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors and proximity sensors, both operating at a sampling frequency of 45 Hz. After the labelling and pre-preocessing, the data set comprises 1,231,213 rows of data. Subsequently, two Machine Learning (ML) models were built and trained on this data set to classify the activities. One model is based on the LeNet architecture and the other employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) equipped with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. The LeNet-based model demonstrated a classification accuracy of 98.5%, while the GRU model achieved an accuracy of 88.1%. This thesis provides valuable insights by assessing the detectability of similar activities by exploring different neural network architectures for human activity detection tasks.\nBachelor Thesis (submission August 2021): An Empirical Study to examine the Relationship between a Leaderâ€™s Machiavellianism and the Followersâ€™ pro-Group unethical behaviour\nAbstract: The present thesis was written as part of the bachelorâ€™s programme at the University of Zurich (UZH) and serves the author to obtain the Bachelor of Arts UZH in Business and Economics. An empirical study was conducted to analyse the relationship between the leaderâ€™s Machiavellianism and the followersâ€™ pro-group unethical behaviour. It was further investigated whether conscientiousness of the followers moderates this relationship. Using regression analysis, the hypotheses have been tested and no support was found for either hypothesis. The results are discussed and recommendations for improving the experiment are made."

    "text": "Hey there! Originally from Switzerland, I am currently living in Vancouver. I have my background in Business and Economics and but decided to switch things up and dive into the universe of Data Science. ðŸš€\nThrough most of my education, I wasnâ€™t exactly best friends with math and technical subjects and tried to dodge whenever possible. But some of the courses were mandatory and I wasnâ€™t able avoid them. The result? I found myself having to retake a statistics class. It wasnâ€™t until I started my Masters in Business and Economics when I had to take yet another mandatory statistics course. But this time I aced the course. A bit suprized but way more encouraged, I started to take more statistics courses and tought myself programming so that I could take computer science courses. Hooked by this newfound fascination, I wanted more and applied for a Master of Data Science.\nNow, I am on a mission, rocking my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at UBC in the heart of Vancouver. When I am not crunching numbers, mastering algorithms or - letâ€™s be honest - fixing bugs, youâ€™ll catch me either soaking in the city buzz or enjoying some outdoor bliss. Whether itâ€™s hiking the Swiss Alps, exploring the beauty of Vancouverâ€™s nature spots or being around horses, I am all about trying to find that perfect mix of data and downtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me\nLearn more about my experiences and background\n\n\n\n\nProjects\nExplore some of my open source projects"
