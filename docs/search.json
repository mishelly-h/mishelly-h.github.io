    "text": "My thesis aimed at providing a proof of concept for a larger project exploring child development and is situated within the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). First, I chose activities that I considered relevant for the given context. What are activities that a child does every day? And how can I break down complex activities into simple activities? I came to the conclusion that I could capture a large portion of daily activities with 10 activities: Walk, Run, Jump, Lie, Stand, Sit & Listen, Sit & Write, Sit & Read, Sit & Computer and Sit & Conversation.\nNext, I designed an experiment to collect the data needed. The experimental setup incorporated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors and proximity sensors, both operating at a sampling frequency of 45 Hz. In order to being able to collect the proximity data, each experiment round was performed in groups of two. In total, six participants participated in the experiment, yielding nearly 12 hours of sensor data. After the labelling and pre-preocessing, the data set comprised 1,231,213 rows of data.\nThen, I built and trained two Machine Learning (ML) models on this data set to classify the activities. One model is based on the LeNet architecture and the other employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. The LeNet-based model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.5%, while the GRU model achieved an accuracy of 88.1%.\nLimitations such as the small sample size of six participants and limited computational power were acknowledged. Further research could focus on increasing the number of activities, improving the performance of the GRU-based RNN and exploring other neural network architectures to better capture dependencies in the data. Overall, the thesis presents a proof of concept for the detection of ten activities related to a persons’s everyday life."

    "text": "From Business to Data Science: During my bachelor thesis, I tried to carry out a data analysis independently for the first time. But I was completely overwhelmed and applied methods to my data that I knew violated model assumptions. This was what ignited the initial spark and motivated me to expand my toolbox. So I started attending more statistics courses during my master’s degree and got more and more insights into coding. Eventually, I started teaching myself how to code in Python in the summer of 2022. But I wanted more and so I changed my minor to Information Systems and decided to use my master thesis as an opportunity to learn about Machine Learning. Convinced that I wanted to improve my skills in statistics and machine learning, I applied for the Master of Data Science. A few months later I sat in a plane flying across the Atlantic…"

    "text": "For my bachelor thesis, I conducted an empirical study to analyse the relationship between the leader’s Machiavellianism and the followers’ pro-group unethical behaviour. Also, I investigated whether conscientiousness of the followers moderates this relationship.\nSome definitions: Machiavellianism refers to a personality trait that is associated with manipulative behaviour, disregard for moral standards and striving for control and status. Pro-group unethical behaviour refers to a concept where an individual engages in unethical behaviour with the intention to support the group. Finally, conscientiousnes is a dimension of the big five personality traits which are used to measure personality. Conscientious individuals are said to be organised, disciplined and tend to adhere by their ethical principles.\nFor employers, it can be crucial to understand the reasons why employees may engage in unethical behaviour. If companies are able to understand the underlying motivation for unethical behaviour, they have the opportunity to recognise warning signals and prevent scandals.\nUsing regression analysis, I tested the hypotheses on data from 115 participants. I found no support for either hypothesis. The results are discussed and recommendations for improving the experiment are made. Limitations of the research are that the experimenter could have influenced the participants in ways that were not accounted for. Furthermore, the participants did know know each other before the experiment and the team spirit for each session greatly varied."
