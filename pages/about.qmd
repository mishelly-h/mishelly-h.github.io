Below a summary of what I have been up to for the last couple of years and how I transitioned from Business and Economics to Data Science.

## Education
During my bachelor thesis, I tried to carry out a data analysis independently for the first time. But I was completely overwhelmed and applied methods to my data that I knew violated model assumptions. This was what ignited the initial spark and motivated me to expand my toolbox. So I started attending more statistics courses during my master's degree and got more and more insights into coding. Eventually, I started teaching myself how to code in Python in the summer of 2022. But I wanted more and so I changed my minor to Information Systems and decided to use my master thesis as an opportunity to learn about Machine Learning. Convinced that I wanted to improve my skills in statistics and machine learning, I applied for the Master of Data Science. A few months later I sat in a plane flying across the Atlantic...

## Work Experience

#### Intern Market Development (FinGuide, Zürich)

During this internship I was involved in building relationships with partners such as fiduciary and lawyers. I made contributions to social media and adapted documents and processed form French-speaking Switzerland to German-speaking Switzerland.


## Hobbies and Interests
During my downtime, I am generally outside. My greatest passion are horses and I love to spend time at the stables. I also enjoy hiking, biking, and swimming as well as skiing in the winter.
