Hey there! Originally from Switzerland, I am currently living in Vancouver. I have my background in Business and Economics and but decided to switch things up and dive  into the universe of Data Science. ðŸš€

Through most of my education, I wasn't exactly best friends with math and technical subjects and tried to dodge whenever possible. But some of the courses were mandatory and I wasn't able avoid them. The result? I found myself having to retake a statistics class. It wasn't until I started my Masters in Business and Economics when I had to take yet another mandatory statistics course. But this time I aced the course. A bit suprized but way more encouraged, I started to take more statistics courses and tought myself programming so that I could take computer science courses. Hooked by this newfound fascination, I wanted more and applied for a Master of Data Science.

Now, I am on a mission, rocking my Master's in Data Science at UBC in the heart of Vancouver. When I am not crunching numbers, mastering algorithms or - let's be honest - fixing bugs, you'll catch me either soaking in the city buzz or enjoying some outdoor bliss. Whether it's hiking the Swiss Alps, exploring the beauty of Vancouver's nature spots or being around horses, I am all about trying to find that perfect mix of data and downtime.
